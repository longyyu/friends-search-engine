The original FRIENDS corpus data came from this Github Repository: [emorynlp/character-mining](https://github.com/emorynlp/character-mining/tree/master/json).  

In this project, these JSON files were called by `data_prep.py` to create the TSV file `script_id_speaker_10seasons.tsv`. After that, the json files will not be needed for the purpose of running this application.  

To unzip the archived JSON files, run `tar xvf json.tar.gz`.
